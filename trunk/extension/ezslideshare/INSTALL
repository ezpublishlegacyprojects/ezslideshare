Prerequisites
=============
eZ Publish
----------
This extension was developed and tested on a 4.2 version, and should seamlessly work on any further version. We cannot guarantee that it works fine on prior versions, although there should not be any problem.
You can download the eZ Publish Community Project here : http://share.ez.no/download

Slideshare API key/share-secret pair
------------------------------------
Get your own API key/shared-secret pair by :
 1. Creating an account on http://www.slideshare.net/ if not already done
 2. Following the steps there : http://www.slideshare.net/developers/applyforapi


Get a hold on it
================
This extension is available from the project's SVN repository : http://projects.ez.no/ezslideshare/subversion. Follow the instructions on this page.

Once on your hard-drive, place the extension (or symlink it) inside the ``extension`` folder of your preferred eZ Publish instance.

Enable the extension
====================
From the administration interface
---------------------------------
Navigate to the administration interface, then click the "Setup" top-menu entry, then the "Extensions" entry in the left-column menu.
The ``ezslideshare`` extension should be listed, next to an unchecked checkbox. Check it, and click the "Apply changes" button.

By editing site.ini.append.php
------------------------------
Spot the site.ini.append.php file where you are activating extensions (can be per siteaccess, or as a general override), and add the following : 

:: 
 
 [ExtensionSettings]
 ... (other extensions being enabled)
 ActiveExtensions[]=ezslideshare

You are maybe enabling extensions per siteaccess. In your siteaccess' site.ini.append.php file : 

:: 

 [ExtensionSettings]
 ... (other extensions being enabled for this siteaccess)
 ActiveAccessExtensions[]=ezslideshare


Regenerate the autoloads files. From the command line, at the root of your eZ Publish installation :

:: 

 $> php bin/php/ezpgenerateautoloads.php 


Install your Slideshare API key/share-secret pair
=================================================
Create an override of the ``ezslideshare.ini.append.php`` file as a global or siteaccess override. Insert your key/shared-secret values in the corresponding configuration directive, as follows : 

:: 

 [SlideshareAPISettings]
 APIKey=<my-key>
 SharedSecret=<my-shared-secret>


Clear caches
============
From the administration interface
---------------------------------
Navigate to the administration interface, then click the "Setup" top-menu entry, then the "Clear all caches" button, in the top box. 

Bear in mind that this should not be done on a running, production instance. If you are in this case, clear the INI cache, then the Template cache, and you should be all set.  


From the command line
---------------------
From the command line, at the root of your eZ Publish installation :

:: 

 $> php bin/php/ezcache.php -s<siteaccess_name> --clear-all
 
Bear in mind that this should not be done on a running, production instance. If you are in this case, clear, the INI cache, then the Template cache, and you should be all set. Can be done as follows : 

:: 

 $> php bin/php/ezcache.php -s<siteaccess_name> --clear-tag=ini
 $> php bin/php/ezcache.php -s<siteaccess_name> --clear-tag=template
